I collect here some expository notes.

0. ***Notes from a talk on the Hilbert-Mumford criterion***. A proof of the Hilbert-Mumford criterion in the projective-over-affine setting is sketched. ([pdf](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/ibaneznunez/documents/notes-hilbert-mumford-criterion.pdf))

0. ***Linearly reductive algebraic groups in characteristic 0***. An expository account of the equivalence between reductivity and linear reductivity in characteristic 0. It also contains a proof of finite generation of the ring of invariants. ([pdf](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/ibaneznunez/documents/linearly-reductive-groups-in-characteristic-0.pdf))

0. ***The absolute Galois group of C(t)*** (in french). An exposition of a proof that the absolute Galois group of **C**(t) is isomorphic to the free profinite group on the set of complex numbers. ([pdf](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/ibaneznunez/documents/le-groupe-de-galois-absolu-de-ct.pdf))
