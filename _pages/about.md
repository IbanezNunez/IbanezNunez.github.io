<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->


I am a Ritt Assistant Professor at Columbia University working in Algebraic Geometry and Moduli Theory.

My research focuses on foundational aspects of algebraic stacks and applications to enumerative geometry, cohomology of moduli spaces and differential equations.

Previously, I did my PhD at the University of Oxford, supervised by [Frances Kirwan](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/frances.kirwan) and [Fabian Haiden](https://semistability.wordpress.com/).

My CV is available [here](documents/CV_andres_ibanez_nunez.pdf).
